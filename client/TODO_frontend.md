## TODO-List Frontend

- proper input validation login screen
- prioritize TODO_Items (meta-TODO anyone?)
- try including framer motion API (for something I guess?)
- add image support with react-dropzone
- adding of entities
- relationship view
- relationship menus in the Detail views
- timeline view
- host website using firebase console
- editable list of tags in details view
- think about replacing recoil with react-query (maybe test if it works)
- define security rules (for example limited deleting dependent on properties) => find out how to do this
- editable entity type on EntityDetailView
- error oundaries, error banners, error components, error pages, error infants (maybe save the last one for later)
