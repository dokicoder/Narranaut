#TODO

##next up

- entity types document
- list entitiy view of all entity types (and get rid of a bunch of redundant code)
- add some edit functionality

##wishlist

- access rights
- data migration and schema versioning (if models change)
- cloud functions to cache data
- general optimization (take into account that this here is a write-heavy application)
